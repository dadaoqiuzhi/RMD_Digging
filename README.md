# RMD_Digging
#1 RMD_digging is developed by the MATLAB language. It is aimed to provide pre-processing and post-processing tools for the reactive molecular dynamics (ReaxFF) simulations performed on the LAMMPS  platform. Its functions involve formatting the reactive force field parameters, statistic anasysis of structures, trajectories and mechanisms and output of the visualization files.
